Notes on jive5ab command set
============================

The following should be noted with respect to the command set:

1. All commands/queries are implemented using the VSI-S communications
   protocol and command/response syntax.
2. Commands/queries are case *insensitive*.
3. Versions of program *jive5ab* with a version earlier than the version
   mentioned in the header of this memo may not implement all commands
   indicated in this memo or, in some cases, may implement them in a
   different way (use ‘version?’ query to get the current *jive5ab*
   version - see ‘System Queries and Responses’). Some commands only
   appeared in later versions of *jive5ab*, in which case it is
   documented what the earliest release supporting that command was.
