        // As of this version (Mar 2011) we separate the condition variable
        // into two flavours: one if someone pushed on the queue and one if
        // someone popped the queue.
        // This was an oversight on my behalf (not separating the two) and
        // may lead to incorrect behaviour when multiple push()ers and
        // pop()pers are present.
        // Before March 2011 the queue did the following:
        //   * there were always only one push()er and one pop()er
        //   * each succesfull push() or pop() triggered a condition
        //    _broadcast_ (stoopid me!)
        // I realised this is both inefficient (if someone did a push() then
        // only a single pop()per needs to be unlocked - all others will
        // find that their condition_wait is still invalid and will re-enter
        // the wait). The solution is: use condition_signal() in case of a
        // succesfull push() or pop().
        // However, this simple scheme (condition_signal() + only one
        // condition-variable) fails if there are an arbitrary, yet >1,
        // number of each of push()ers or pop()pers.
        // condition_signal() only unlocks 1 waiting thread on the
        // condition-variable that's signalled. Suppose there are three
        // threads involved: two pushers and one popper and the queue is
        // empty and has only room for one slot.
        // If the first pusher pushes and does a condition_signal then it
        // might just be that the other pusher gets woken up (remember: all
        // three threads are blocked on the same condition). that one
        // decides it cannot push (the one empty slot is filled by now) and
        // the popper doesn't wake up so the filled slot does not get
        // emptied => deadlock, i.e. #FAIL.
        // You could go back to condition_broadcast() (all blocked threads
        // get woken up so the popper, when woken up, will detect "ah, I
        // *can* pop" and resolve the deadlock (note: this will again create
        // a condition_broadcast!). This is highly inefficient since you get
        // 2*(N-1) wakeups (once because of the first pusher succeeding
        // and another one because of the succesfull pop).
        //
        // The best and correct way is to have separate push() and pop()
        // conditions - each thread can wait + signal on the appropriate condition.
        //  
        // In fact, it became even slightly more efficient: the code now
        // only signals when it is possible that someone is blocking waiting
        // on you:
        //    * if you just popped then you only need to signal a
        //      (potential) pusher if there is exactly one free slot left:
        //      this implies that the queue was full before you popped, i.e.
        //      pushers could be blocking waiting on someone, not unlike
        //      you, making space.
        //    * the same applies for pushers pushing the/a first element on
        //      queue: only then there may be poppers in a blocking wait.
        // In all other cases there is no need to signal since there is
        // either space available/are elements available so neither the
        // pushers nor the pushers will go into a blocking wait ...
